## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

InsiteWear Ai agent  follows a client-server architecture:

### Client (Next.js + React)
- Modern React application built with Next.js
- Real-time streaming updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Components for message display, search status, and input handling

### Server (FastAPI + LangGraph)
- Python backend using FastAPI for API endpoints
- LangGraph implementation for conversation flow with LLM and tools
- Integration with Tavily Search API for web searching capabilities
- Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming of AI responses

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API key
- Tavily API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alokv0521/insitewear-ai-agent

2. **Set up the server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Configure environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the server directory:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   
4. **Set up the client**
```bash
cd ../client
npm install

### Running the Application

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   uvicorn app:app --reload

2. **Start the client**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev

3. **Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000**   

## üîç How It Works

1. **User sends a message** through the chat interface
2. **Server processes the message** using GPT-4o
3. **AI decides** whether to use search or respond directly
4. If search is needed:
   - Search query is sent to Tavily API
   - Results are processed and provided back to the AI
   - AI uses this information to formulate a response
5. **Response is streamed** back to the client in real-time
6. **Search stages are displayed** to the user (searching, reading, writing)
